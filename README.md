ISBoxer files for Multiboxing in FFXIV
This file is the save.xml used to load my team into isboxer. I also included the pictures i use for the menu images.

just add the picture folder to innerspace/scripts
put the xml in innerspace/

In order for this profile to work you need to have a collapsing Hotbar setup and many macros. i have included my save files for my characters UI/Macros that you can load up to give it a shot i recommend you back up all of your UI files first.
